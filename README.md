# Recommendation-System

By finding users in the database that have similar ratings for movies like you and weighting their input to provide a more personal recommendation for the users of my program. It provides various filters for like, range of Year of release, average rating, playtime, rated by the specific raters, the minimum number of ratings.

It first finds the raters with ratings of movies similar to your ratings in order from most similar taste in movies to least using a specific relatability index, and then further applies the filters of your choice.
Also, it is made in the most efficient way possible using the most efficient possible data structures and algorithms for certain tasks.

The program is being hosted on a third-party website of an Educational Institute from where this guided project idea was taken. I had to just upload the jar file of my Java Project. The front end was already configured on the link so that the students can host their projects directly with their unique links for each of their projects.
